# Atomic Design

This project adheres to the Atomic Design styles of atom, molecule, and organism. This design system helps us create a consistent, scalable, and maintainable user interface.

## Directory Structure

The project follows a clear directory structure based on the Atomic Design principles:

1. `components/`: This directory contains all the Vue components for our application.

2. `components/atoms/`: This directory contains the smallest, most basic components that can be used to build more complex components. They usually represent single UI elements, like a button or input.

3. `components/molecules/`: This directory contains combinations of atoms that work together to create more complex UI patterns. They usually represent groups of related elements, like a form or a card.

4. `components/organisms/`: This directory contains larger components that represent larger sections of your application, like headers or footers.

5. `components/templates/`: This directory contains the main layout components that define the overall structure of your application.

## Best Practices

To ensure the consistency and quality of our components, we follow these best practices:

1. Keep components small and focused.
2. Use descriptive, self-explanatory names for your components.
3. Ensure that each component serves a specific purpose within our application.
