# Vue 3 Project - Atomic Design - Organisms

This Vue 3 project adheres to the Atomic Design styles of atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates. This design system helps us create a consistent, scalable, and maintainable user interface.

## Directory Structure

The project follows a clear directory structure based on the Atomic Design principles. The `components/organisms/` directory contains the combination of smaller, reusable components that work together to create more complex UI patterns, such as headers, footers, and entire pages.

## Best Practices

To ensure the consistency and quality of our components, we follow these best practices:

1. Keep components small and focused.
2. Use descriptive, self-explanatory names for your components.
3. Ensure that each component serves a specific purpose within our application.

## Examples of Organism Components

Here are 5 examples of Vue 3 components that could be classified as "Organisms" based on the Atomic Design system. "Organisms" are big components that are made up of smaller, reusable molecules. An organism  work together to create more complex and useful things, like headers, footers, and entire pages. These organisms are like the big, important parts of a website or app, and they're made up of smaller, simpler parts that work together.
