# Atomic Design - Molecules

This Vue 3 project adheres to the Atomic Design styles of atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates. This design system helps us create a consistent, scalable, and maintainable user interface.

## Directory Structure

The project follows a clear directory structure based on the Atomic Design principles. The `components/molecules/` directory contains the combination of smaller, reusable components that work together to create more complex UI patterns.

## Best Practices

To ensure the consistency and quality of our components, we follow these best practices:

1. Keep components small and focused.
2. Use descriptive, self-explanatory names for your components.
3. Ensure that each component serves a specific purpose within our application.

## Examples of Molecule Components

Here are 20 examples of Vue 3 components that could be classified as "Molecules" based on the Atomic Design system. A molecule is a combination of smaller, reusable "atoms" that work together to create more complex UI patterns (molecules). They're typically composed of multiple "atoms" such as buttons, inputs, and selects, which are combined to serve a specific purpose within an application. Molecules help to create a consistent and scalable user interface by reusing and combining smaller, well-defined components.
