# Vue 3 Project - Atomic Design - Templates

This Vue 3 project adheres to the Atomic Design styles of atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates. This design system helps us create a consistent, scalable, and maintainable user interface.

## Directory Structure

The project follows a clear directory structure based on the Atomic Design principles. The `components/templates/` directory contains the combination of smaller, reusable components (organisms). Templates are intended for pre-designed layouts that can be used as a starting point for creating new pages or sections within an application.

## Best Practices

To ensure the consistency and quality of our components, we follow these best practices:

1. Keep components small and focused.
2. Use descriptive, self-explanatory names for your components.
3. Ensure that each component serves a specific purpose within our application.

## Examples of Template Components

Here are 5 examples of Vue 3 components that could be classified as "Template" components based on the Atomic Design system. A template component is a reusable, pre-designed layout that can be used as a starting point for creating new pages or sections within an application. These template components help to create a consistent and scalable user interface by providing a well-defined structure and design that can be easily customized and extended.

1. `TemplateAdminDashboard.vue`
2. `TemplateUserProfile.vue`
3. `TemplateSearchResults.vue`
4. `TemplateProductList.vue`
5. `TemplateBlogPost.vue`
